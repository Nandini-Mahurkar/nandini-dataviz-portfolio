# Outline

My project focuses on addressing the issue of adulteration in growth supplements, with a particular emphasis on the rise of whey protein consumption in India. An independent, self-funded study conducted on protein supplements revealed a disturbing truth: the majority of products did not contain the advertised protein content. In addition to these fraudulent claims, the study uncovered the presence of fungal toxins, heavy metals, and pesticides in several reputed brands.

Through this project, I aim to visualize this alarming research in a way that is easily understandable for the average consumer. It is truly shameful that brands with such low-quality standards often target the active and health-conscious community, deceiving them into purchasing products that are, at best, misleading and, at worst, dangerous to consume.

# As a user I want....

As a reader, I want to learn more about the safety of protein supplements that I regularly consume so that I can make the right consumer choices for my health and safety. I can do this by learning more about the Quality Control in different popular supplement brands.


## Initial sketches
The following sketches represent the whey protein usage in India as well as the differences that were present between the Labels and detected protein. These are my initial sketches that I plan on using for developing my case.

(The red bars represent the protein labels that showed the greatest differences)

I have included the second chart to show that the protein market in India is continuously rising. As we can see, a huge number of people are consuming protein, and so a quality control mechanism is indeed essential.

# The data
The dataset I used to create the first visualization is sourced from the article "Citizens Protein Project: A self-funded, transparent, and concerning report on analysis of popular protein supplements sold in the Indian market" by Philips et al. (2024). This article contains analysis of the protein market in India. The data is publicly available on the PMC website, and contains details of the differences of labelled and detected protein. I plan to use this article to understand the market trends, and consumer safety issues related to whey protein supplements available in India. This table also has information about the manufacturers, and I plan on using this data to calculate the average differences in the labelled and detected protein percentages.

You can access the dataset from the following link: [Data Source](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10994440/figure/SD3/)

The second visualisation is created using the data I sourced from the _India Whey Protein Market Size, Share & Trends Analysis Report by Grand View Research (2024)_. I used this to showcase the market trends of the protein market in India and the future projected growth of the same.

Additionally, I will create a dataset of most frequently used brands, by distributing a google form.

# Method and medium
I plan on using Tableau to generate graphs and charts to convey my story. Along with this, I will be creating a Shorthand website to present my findings. I will also use Lucidchart to create rough sketches of my visualisations.
