# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

I have created a Shorthand website to develop my story. I developed Part 2 based on the Part 1 outline and expanded my story further using Shorthand. The visualizations were designed using Tableau and DataWrapper.

# User research 

## Target audience

The target audience are the people who to the gym and consume whey protein as a part of their fitness routine for muscle growth. I hope to reach them with my story and shed light on the hidden truths of the whey protein market, and industry practices that the consumers should be aware of. Many people trust whey protein products to provide them with essential nutrition. However, the industry is not always as reliable as it appears.
I hope to empower these consumers by presenting well-researched insights to make better choices for their body. 

These are the people I interviewed:

1. Graduate Student, male, early 20s, goes to the gym, comsumes whey protein
2. Architect, late 20s, female, goes to the gym, comsumes whey protein
3. Graduate Student, early 20s, female, goes to the gym, comsumes whey protein

| Questions               | Interview 1 (briefly describe) | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| What is your initial perception of the website? | The data is properly highlighted, research is concise, and graphs are impressive and easy to read compared to websites that contain too much content.           |   The website has presenting everything properly with impressive charts.          | The visualizations are making the content easier to understand than research papers.            |
| Why do you consume whey protein? What do you expect from this product?        |   The Indian diet consists mainly of carbohydrates, with limited protein. It's difficult to meet daily protein intake and whey protein helps to complete the protein requirement                        | My trainer recommended it, and after trying it, I saw muscle growth. Now, I consume it regularly        |   I go to the gym and need protein for muscle growth. Whey protein is lower in calories compared to other sources of protein.          |
| Are you aware about the mislabelling of protein content in the products and the hidden additives?                      |     Yes, I am aware. Many affordable Indian products contain poor-quality protein and hidden additives like aflatoxins. Since they are cheap, people prefer to have them. |  Yes. But I wasn't aware of the details.          |   No, I wasn't aware          |
|  Did my website raise concerns? Was it impactful?                        |    Yes, it grabbed my attention.It was shocking to learn about mislabeling of One Science protein, which I used to consume regularly. It definitely raised concerns.       |  Yes, I already knew about mislabeling, but discovered hidden truths like heavy metals and aflatoxins.          |  Yes.           |
|  What was difficult to interpret in my website?                       |  Nothing, the bar graphs and charts were engaging. The graphics were concise.    |  The figures had small text that was hard to read.            |    The bar chart with the green color was confusing, especially because it had the "don’t be fooled" label.         |
|   Did you encounter any sections that were confusing on the website?                             | No, everything was clear.                            |   The section with "don’t be fooled" label.     |    No         |
|   How effective was the website in making you reconsider your purchasing decisions?            |    Very effective. I used to trust the brand "one science" But after learning about mislabeling, I will reconsider my choices.       | Very effective. Now, I will research before purchasing these products.     |  Extremely effective.  |
