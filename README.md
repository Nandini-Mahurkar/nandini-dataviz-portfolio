# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably hire me. 

# About me
Hello! I am Nandini Mahurkar, a MISM student at CMU. I am deeply passionate about Data Science and Machine Learning. I was a Data & Services intern at Mastercard where I worked on modelling using AI and Deep Learning. Last year, I presented a research paper - “Erasure Coding and Data Deduplication: A Comprehensive Survey” at an IEEE conference. 
I am the first in my family to study abroad and I want to make them proud!
I’m always excited to find better ways to innovate and make a positive impact! Feel free to connect if you want to talk about AI/ML/Data Science! 


# What I hope to learn

- Creating effective & impactful visualisations
- How color influences the presentation of a narrative
- Using the skills learned in class for data analysis
