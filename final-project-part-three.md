# The final data story

I've been hitting the gym for a while and regularly consuming whey protein, but I recently came across a startling truth. 

My story is shedding light on the hidden truths of the Whey Protein Market in India. The Whey Protein market in India is continuously growing. With such high consumption, you would expect these products to be safe right? But a study has uncovered the sad truths of this industry. With my project, I have explained, uncovered and visualized these truths. 

The brands had lesser protein than advertised. It wasn't just this, they also found harmful substances in these products. Please navigate to my website to know more...

I have pulled my data from the [Citizens Protein Project](https://journals.lww.com/md-journal/fulltext/2024/04050/citizens_protein_project__a_self_funded,.15.aspx) published in the Medicine Journal. I have used Datawrapper & Tableau to create visualizations.

# Changes made since Part II

- Increased the font size of all graph headlines.  
- Properly cited data sources for the graphs.  
- Refined the call to action by breaking it into three sections. Before Part III, it was mostly high-level.  
- Added guidance on identifying safe products for consumption.  
- Changed the colors of the "Minimal Differences" and "Low Heavy Metal Traces" graphs.  
- Included definitions for complex terms like 'Hepatotoxicity'.  

## The audience

My audience are the individuals who regularly consume whey protein to meet their protein requirements. To tailor my story to this audience, I added a section that helps identify whether whey protein brands are safe for consumption.

# Final thoughts

I was aware of this study before starting this project, but through visualizations and research, I uncovered additional truths, such as the presence of harmful substances. Before starting this project, I was only aware of the mislabelling. This experience improved my storytelling skills and helped me in selecting the right protein for myself.
