# Outline

My project focuses on addressing the issue of adulteration in growth supplements, with a particular emphasis on the rise of whey protein consumption in India. An independent, self-funded study conducted on protein supplements revealed a disturbing truth: the majority of products did not contain the advertised protein content. In addition to these fraudulent claims, the study uncovered the presence of fungal toxins, heavy metals, and pesticides in several reputed brands.

Through this project, I aim to visualize this alarming research in a way that is easily understandable for the average consumer. It is truly shameful that brands with such low-quality standards often target the active and health-conscious community, deceiving them into purchasing products that are, at best, misleading and, at worst, dangerous to consume.

# As a user I want....

As a reader, I want to learn more about the safety of protein supplements that I regularly consume so that I can make the right consumer choices for my health and safety. I can do this by learning more about the QC in different popular supplement brands.


## Initial sketches
The following sketches represent the whey protein usage in India as well as the Differnces that were present between the Labels and detected protein. These are my initial sketches that I plan on using for developing my case.
