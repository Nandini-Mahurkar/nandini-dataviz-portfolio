# Critique by redesign

I have chosen **Drink & Dating** data visualization from MakeoverMonday for this activity. 

## Step one: the visualization

[Click on this link to view the original data visualization!](https://dribbble.com/shots/10539609-Drink-and-Dating-Infographics)

Why I chose this visualisation:
1. The topic, dating & drinking is relatable for a wide audience, as compared to technical or niche data visualizations. So, my intent is for the general audience to understand and interpret this visualization.
2. The bar comparison between men and women provides valuable insights, but the graph is challenging to interpret. My goal is to make the visualization clearer and more user friendly.
3. This visualization has some unclear wording, like the phrase '65% of the USAâ€™s adult populations are drink,' which can be confusing. By critiquing it, I want to make sure the information is clear, accurate, and easy to understand.

## Step two: the critique

The visualization at the first glance is distracting. 
1. At the top, two hearts are used, where the first one is completely red for 65% and the second one is partially red even though it is representing 72%. This is inconsistent and can easily confuse the viewers. 
2. The text for the heart displaying 65% is incomplete. The percentage 65% appears in gray, while 72% is shown in red. To maintain consistency, both 65% and 72% should be in the same color.
3. The headline is vague and not appealing. Using something like "Most Popular drinks for dates" or "Daters' Drink Preferences" is better.
4. Using two bar charts side-by-side is confusing. Instead using a grouped bar chart is better. 
5. Using different colors for the two genders would be better as we will be able to clearly distinguish between the two.
6. The bar charts are not sorted properly. The bars should be sorted on either of the two genders, according to the percentages.
7. The percentages lack a scale, and the differences between the percentages cannot be perceived properly. 

What I liked & What stood out:

1. The text is concise and conveys the information effectively.
2. Use of a bottle to represent the drinking percentage.
3. I like the mention of the app 'Zoosk' and the statistics of survey. This makes the viewers believe that the data is reliable. 
4. Clear and straightforward comparison of the daters with the US population.

## Step three: Sketch a solution

![sketch](critique_sketch.png)

My approach for the redesign was to make the data easy to read and understand, as the topic is relatable for the general population. So, I first started with the title, as the original one is too vague. I changed it to : Most popular drinks for dates. I want the viewers to trust the data, so I kept the mention of the app Zoosk, and the details of the survey. Next, I replaced the hearts with donut charts, to make it more readable. But, I added a little heart and a bottle icon beside the title to better represent the data visualization. I replaced the side-to-side bar charts, to a grouped bar chart, as the original bars were distracting. They were not sorted in any order, and added to the confusion. I used a blue bar for men and a pink bar for women to make the visualization easier to interpret.


## Step four: Test the solution

Interview 1: Student, MAM
Interview 2: Student, MISM & MAM
Interview 3: Student, MISM-BIDA


| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| What is this graphic about? | Most popular drinks by gender for dates | Comparison of men's and women's drink preferences on dates| Most popular drinks by gender for dates |  
| Is there anything you find confusing? | No            | The two percentages next to the donut charts are confusing            | The two percentages next to the donut chart are confusing |
| Who do you think is the intended audience? |  People who date           | Alcohol companies, advertising companies            | People who date   |
| Is there anything you would change or do differently? |  No           | Pick one story, and stick to it.            | Remove the percentages next to the donut chart   |
| Are the colors too overwhelming? |  No           | No            | No   |


Synthesis: 

The most common feedback was about the percentages next to the donut charts. They were confusing to them, and they felt they did not add much to the story. They also asked me to decide on one story. The potential storylines could be: "Men vs. Women: Drinking Patterns" or "Alcoholic vs. Non-Alcoholic Beverage Consumption." They also asked me to move the survey line to the bottom. Another common suggestion was to cite the source.

Design Changes I will incorporate:
1. Decide on a storyline.
2. Shift the survey line to the bottom.
3. Change the title


## Step five: build the solution

I decided on a storyline: **Wine vs. Beer: The Gender Showdown in Date Night Drink Choices**. I also removed the donut charts, as they are not relevant to the story anymore. I moved the survey line: "The dating app Zoosk surveyed 8,793 of its members and analyzed 133,175 dating messages" to the bottom, and also added a source. I kept the grouped bar charts and used the same colors, as they got a positive feedback in the interviews. I also kept the heart & bottle icon, as I got positive feedback on it. 
I created the visualization on DataWrapper, and created the heart & bottle icon on canva. 

<iframe title="Wine vs. Beer:
The Gender Showdown in Date Night Drink Choices" aria-label="Grouped Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-rcW4u" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/rcW4u/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="644" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script>
